ABOUT PROJECT:

Our project mainly contains the UI to shop a product with an end to end flow.

Initially the landing page contains all the category names and mandatory options like login,register,cart,account pages 
and also it contains some cool animations and corousel which helps to give a vibe to our project as they were also involved in original site.

later to maintain a good shoping experience i created three product pages for new arrivals, earrings and necklace.
The user can get their desired product by filtering trough price, color, material and also by sorting ,we hope this makes user experience more better.

Next on clicking any product extra information is shown and there will be option to add to cart or wishlist and he/she can shop further by adding more or can directly jump to cart page and verify the price with items added , they can get the total.

Finally they can checkout with their address and payment details  to plcae the order.

This is how we made our best to make it as best as possible in the given time limit and with things we learned.

Here ends this short note on our project.
Thank you
